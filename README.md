## Movie Website
This Python project aims to create a customizable movie website using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Bootstrap, WTForms, and requests. The website provides a user-friendly interface to search for movies, add reviews and ratings, and displays personalized movie lists ranked from 1. By integrating with an online movie database through API requests, the website fetches movie information and adds it to your list.

Features
- Search for movies: Users can easily search for movies using the provided search functionality.
- Add reviews and ratings: Users can contribute their own reviews and ratings for movies they have watched.
- Personalized movie lists: The website automatically ranks the user's movie list, making it easy to discover top-rated movies.
- API integration: By leveraging an online movie database API, the website fetches detailed movie information.

This project offers an opportunity to learn about database connections, API integration, form handling, and responsive web design.
